It's not. You think the only threat is other humans. It's not. Monsters are real. Demons are real. Vampires are real. And I'm about to become one of them. My name is Arianna Spero. I was an ordinary girl, living an ordinary life, until my mother lapsed into a coma. Now, I am her only hope. She made a deal with the devil, and on my 18th birthday he came to collect. But there's a way to save her. There's something the princes of hell want more than my mother. Me. So I signed my soul away and promised to pick a prince to marry. I would take the blood oath, become one of them, and give them an heir. I would become a princess of hell, and my mother would live. I expected fire and brimstone. I expected pain and misery.

I enjoyed this book so much that I forced myself to read slowly as I just could not bear for it to end… I thought the story was brilliant. The characters were creative and kept me hooked. ‘The twists and turns kept me gasping for more… Could not recommend this book any more highly!’ Crime Book Junkie ‘This is a well written supernatural detective story, with a surprising twist that I guarantee will keep you glued to the last page… at times I couldn’t turn the pages quickly enough, it’s atmospheric, gritty and at times just plain scary, and what a twist at the end.’ The Book Review Café ‘With a brilliant cast of crime characters, and a plot that was enough to make me feel dizzy, this was a compelling book that I just couldn't get enough of. Every word, every page, every murder, every guess... I couldn't wait for the final piece of the jigsaw to fit into place… the word 'thrilling' just doesn't do this justice.’ Becca’s Books ...more",Fantasy
